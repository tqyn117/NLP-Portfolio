# ChatBot Project
This is a chatbot project for the course "Natural Language Processing" at the University of Texas at Dallas,
written by Brenden Healey and Quy Giang.
It is a chatbot that can answer questions and give recommendations about movies.

This chatbot was implemented from scratch as opposed to a pre-existing framework, and as such has a few quirks.

Ensure that nltk, pickle, and pandas are installed on the system.
Run netflix_curator.py to start the chatbot.

When introducing yourself, the most reliable method is to say "My name is <Name>." Capitalizing your name will help the POS tagger identify it.
Capitalizing proper nouns will help ensure the bot understands what you say.
